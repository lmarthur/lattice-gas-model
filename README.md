# lattice-gas-model
This is a simple lattice gas simulation for agents in a landscape. 
It remains a work in progress--the rest of the framework should go up in the next couple of weeks, along with documentation.

As the repository is currently structured, each folder will contain a given simulation run, with parameters indicated in the folder name. Each folder will (eventually) contain the agent and environment classes used in the run, the simulation and analysis code used, along with the reduced simulation data and the plots produced. Clearly, this is not all here yet. I will also try to include some further documentation.
